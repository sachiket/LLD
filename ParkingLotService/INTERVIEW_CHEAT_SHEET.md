# üéØ Parking Lot System - Interview Cheat Sheet

## Quick Overview (30 seconds)
- **Multi-floor parking system** with different vehicle types (Bike, Car, Truck)
- **4 Design Patterns**: Strategy, Factory, Observer, Singleton
- **All SOLID principles** implemented
- **Real-time notifications** and fee calculation
- **Extensible architecture** for easy feature additions

## Key Design Patterns (2 minutes)

### 1. Strategy Pattern üéØ
```java
// Different fee calculation strategies
FeeCalculationStrategy strategy = new HourlyFeeCalculationStrategy();
double fee = strategy.calculateFee(ticket);
```
**Why**: Makes fee calculation algorithms interchangeable

### 2. Factory Pattern üè≠
```java
// Centralized ticket creation
ParkingTicket ticket = ParkingTicketFactory.createTicket(vehicle, slot);
```
**Why**: Consistent object creation with auto-generated IDs

### 3. Observer Pattern üëÅÔ∏è
```java
// Event-driven notifications
parkingService.addObserver(new ConsoleNotificationObserver());
```
**Why**: Loose coupling for notifications and events

### 4. Singleton Pattern üîí
```java
// Global parking lot management
ParkingLotManager manager = ParkingLotManager.getInstance();
```
**Why**: Single point of access for multiple parking lots

## SOLID Principles (2 minutes)

| Principle | Implementation | Example |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| **SRP** | Each class has one responsibility | `ParkingDisplayService` only handles display |
| **OCP** | Open for extension, closed for modification | Add new `FeeCalculationStrategy` without changing existing code |
| **LSP** | Subtypes are substitutable | Any `FeeCalculationStrategy` can replace another |
| **ISP** | Interface segregation | `ParkingEventObserver` only has parking-related methods |
| **DIP** | Depend on abstractions | `ParkingLotServiceImpl` depends on interfaces, not concrete classes |

## Common Interview Questions (5 minutes)

### Q: How to handle concurrent access?
**A**: Use `synchronized` methods or `ReentrantLock` for thread-safe slot allocation

### Q: How to add new vehicle types?
**A**: 
1. Add to `VehicleType` enum
2. Update `ParkingSlot.canFitVehicle()` 
3. Add rate in `HourlyFeeCalculationStrategy`
4. **No existing code modification needed!**

### Q: How to implement different pricing?
**A**: Create new `FeeCalculationStrategy` implementation:
```java
public class PeakHourFeeCalculationStrategy implements FeeCalculationStrategy {
    // 1.5x normal rates during peak hours
}
```

### Q: How to scale for multiple parking lots?
**A**: Use `ParkingLotManager` singleton + microservices architecture

### Q: How to add payment processing?
**A**: Add Payment Strategy Pattern:
```java
public interface PaymentStrategy {
    boolean processPayment(double amount);
}
```

## Architecture Highlights (1 minute)

```
üìÅ Clean Architecture:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Models (Entities)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Services (Business Logic) 
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Strategies (Algorithms)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Factories (Object Creation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Observers (Event Handling)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Managers (Global State)
```

## Extension Points (1 minute)

### Easy (15-30 min):
- New vehicle type
- New pricing strategy  
- New notification method

### Medium (30-45 min):
- Reservation system
- Payment integration
- Multi-location support

### Advanced (45+ min):
- Database integration
- REST API
- Real-time analytics

## Key Talking Points

1. **"I implemented 4 major design patterns..."**
2. **"All SOLID principles are demonstrated..."**
3. **"The system is highly extensible..."**
4. **"Observer pattern enables loose coupling..."**
5. **"Strategy pattern makes algorithms interchangeable..."**

## Demo Flow (2 minutes)
1. Show parking vehicles of different types
2. Demonstrate real-time notifications
3. Show fee calculation
4. Display parking lot status
5. Explain how to extend (add new vehicle type)
