# üéØ Parking Lot System - Interview Strategy & Mindset

## üöÄ **SIMPLE START - Don't Overwhelm!**

### **Step 1: Start with the BASICS (2 minutes)**
```
"Let me design a simple parking lot system step by step..."
```

**Start with just 3 core classes:**
1. **`Vehicle`** - What we're parking
2. **`ParkingSlot`** - Where we park
3. **`ParkingLot`** - Container for slots

```java
// Start SIMPLE
class Vehicle {
    String licenseNumber;
    VehicleType type; // BIKE, CAR, TRUCK
}

class ParkingSlot {
    int slotNumber;
    SlotSize size; // SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE
    boolean isAvailable;
    Vehicle parkedVehicle;
}

class ParkingLot {
    List<ParkingSlot> slots;
    
    // Core methods
    ParkingSlot findAvailableSlot(VehicleType type);
    boolean parkVehicle(Vehicle vehicle);
}
```

**Say:** *"This covers the basic functionality. Now let me enhance it..."*

---

## üéØ **Interview Mindset - Think Like This:**

### **Phase 1: Requirements (30 seconds)**
**Ask these questions:**
- "What types of vehicles?" ‚Üí Bike, Car, Truck
- "Different slot sizes?" ‚Üí Small, Medium, Large  
- "Fee calculation needed?" ‚Üí Yes, hourly rates
- "Multiple floors?" ‚Üí Yes, scalable design

### **Phase 2: Core Design (2 minutes)**
**Think out loud:**
- "I need to model the real world..."
- "A parking lot has floors, floors have slots"
- "Different vehicles need different slot sizes"
- "I should separate concerns for clean code"

### **Phase 3: Add Complexity Gradually (5-10 minutes)**
**Don't jump to patterns immediately!**
1. First make it work
2. Then make it clean
3. Then add patterns

---

## üìù **Step-by-Step Interview Approach**

### **STEP 1: Basic Structure (2 min)**
```java
// Start here - just make it work!
class ParkingLot {
    List<ParkingSlot> slots;
    
    boolean parkVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) {
        for (ParkingSlot slot : slots) {
            if (slot.canFit(vehicle) && slot.isAvailable()) {
                slot.park(vehicle);
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false; // No space
    }
}
```

**Say:** *"This works, but let me improve the design..."*

### **STEP 2: Add Floors (1 min)**
```java
class Floor {
    int floorNumber;
    List<ParkingSlot> slots;
}

class ParkingLot {
    List<Floor> floors; // Now supports multiple floors
}
```

**Say:** *"Now it's scalable for multiple floors..."*

### **STEP 3: Add Service Layer (2 min)**
```java
interface ParkingLotService {
    ParkingTicket parkVehicle(Vehicle vehicle);
    double unparkVehicle(String ticketId);
}

class ParkingLotServiceImpl implements ParkingLotService {
    // Implementation here
}
```

**Say:** *"I'm separating business logic from data models..."*

### **STEP 4: Add Design Patterns (5 min)**
**Only NOW introduce patterns:**

**Strategy Pattern:**
```java
interface FeeCalculationStrategy {
    double calculateFee(ParkingTicket ticket);
}
```
**Say:** *"Different pricing strategies can be plugged in..."*

**Factory Pattern:**
```java
class ParkingTicketFactory {
    static ParkingTicket createTicket(Vehicle vehicle, ParkingSlot slot);
}
```
**Say:** *"Centralized ticket creation with consistent IDs..."*

---

## üß† **Mental Framework for Interviews**

### **1. Problem-Solving Mindset**
```
Real World ‚Üí Code World
- Parking Lot ‚Üí ParkingLot class
- Floors ‚Üí Floor class  
- Slots ‚Üí ParkingSlot class
- Vehicles ‚Üí Vehicle class
- Tickets ‚Üí ParkingTicket class
```

### **2. Progressive Enhancement**
```
Basic ‚Üí Better ‚Üí Best
1. Make it work (basic classes)
2. Make it clean (separate concerns)
3. Make it extensible (design patterns)
```

### **3. Always Explain Your Thinking**
**Say things like:**
- *"Let me start with the core entities..."*
- *"I'm thinking about real-world relationships..."*
- *"This violates single responsibility, let me fix it..."*
- *"I can make this more flexible with a strategy pattern..."*

---

## üé§ **What to Say During Interview**

### **Opening (30 seconds):**
*"I'll design a parking lot system that can handle multiple vehicle types, different slot sizes, and calculate fees. Let me start with the core entities and build up..."*

### **While Coding (ongoing):**
- *"I'm modeling this after real-world relationships..."*
- *"Let me separate concerns here for better maintainability..."*
- *"This hard-coded logic should be made configurable..."*
- *"I can use a strategy pattern to make fee calculation flexible..."*

### **When Adding Patterns:**
- *"Now I'll apply some design patterns to make this more robust..."*
- *"Strategy pattern here allows different pricing models..."*
- *"Factory pattern ensures consistent object creation..."*
- *"Observer pattern will help with notifications..."*

### **Closing:**
*"This design is extensible - we can easily add new vehicle types, pricing strategies, or notification methods without changing existing code."*

## üéØ **Key Success Factors**

### **1. Start Simple, Build Up**
- Don't overwhelm with complexity initially
- Show progressive thinking
- Demonstrate problem-solving approach

### **2. Explain Your Reasoning**
- Think out loud
- Justify design decisions
- Show awareness of trade-offs

### **3. Show Pattern Knowledge**
- Introduce patterns naturally
- Explain why each pattern helps
- Don't force patterns where they don't fit

### **4. Handle Questions Gracefully**

- Write everything at once
- Ignore the interviewer's questions
- Over-engineer simple requirements

### **‚úÖ Do This Instead:**
- Build incrementally
- Engage with the interviewer
- Ask clarifying questions
- Show clean, readable code
