## üöÄ 30-Second Elevator Pitch

> "I've implemented a comprehensive BookMyShow system demonstrating **4 major design patterns** (Strategy, Factory, Observer, Singleton), all **SOLID principles**, and **complete OOP implementation**. The system handles **multi-theater movie booking** with **real-time seat management**, **dynamic pricing**, and **event-driven notifications**. It's designed for **scalability** and **extensibility** - perfect for demonstrating **enterprise-level architecture** in a **1-hour interview**."

---

## üìà Progressive Implementation Strategy

### **Phase 1: Foundation (15 minutes)**
```
1. Start with core models: Movie, Theater, Screen, Seat
2. Implement basic enums: SeatType, BookingStatus
3. Show clean OOP principles from the start
```

**What to say**: *"I'm starting with the core domain models to establish a solid foundation. Notice how I'm using encapsulation and immutable fields where appropriate."*

### **Phase 2: Business Logic (20 minutes)**
```
1. Implement Show and Booking models
2. Add BookMyShowService interface
3. Create basic service implementation
```

**What to say**: *"Now I'm adding the business logic layer. I'm using interface-based design to ensure loose coupling and testability."*

### **Phase 3: Design Patterns (15 minutes)**
```
1. Implement Strategy pattern for pricing
2. Add Factory pattern for booking creation
3. Introduce Observer pattern for notifications
```

**What to say**: *"Let me demonstrate some key design patterns. The Strategy pattern makes pricing algorithms interchangeable, following the Open/Closed principle."*

### **Phase 4: Polish & Demo (10 minutes)**
```
1. Add Singleton TheaterManager
2. Create comprehensive Main class
3. Demonstrate all functionality
```

**What to say**: *"Finally, I'll add a Singleton for global theater management and create a demo that shows all the patterns working together."*

## ‚è∞ Time Management

### **If you have 45 minutes:**
- Skip Observer pattern initially
- Focus on core booking functionality
- Add one design pattern (Strategy for pricing)

### **If you have 60 minutes:**
- Implement all 4 design patterns
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Create detailed demo scenarios

### **If you have 90 minutes:**
- Add advanced features (seat reservation timeout)
- Implement additional pricing strategies
- Add comprehensive logging and validation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### **1. Over-Engineering Early**
‚ùå **Don't**: Start with complex inheritance hierarchies
‚úÖ **Do**: Begin with simple, clean models

### **2. Ignoring SOLID Principles**
‚ùå **Don't**: Put everything in one service class
‚úÖ **Do**: Separate concerns from the beginning

### **3. Poor Naming Conventions**
‚ùå **Don't**: Use generic names like `Manager`, `Handler`
‚úÖ **Do**: Use specific, meaningful names like `BookingFactory`, `PricingStrategy`

### **4. Forgetting Error Handling**
‚ùå **Don't**: Assume all operations succeed
‚úÖ **Do**: Add validation and exception handling

### **5. No Demo/Testing**
‚ùå **Don't**: Just write code without running it
‚úÖ **Do**: Create a working demo that shows all features

## üåü Impressive Extensions

### **Easy Wins (5-10 minutes)**
```java
// Weekend Pricing Strategy
public class WeekendPricingStrategy implements PricingStrategy {
    @Override
    public double calculatePrice(Show show, List<Seat> seats) {
        double basePrice = new StandardPricingStrategy().calculatePrice(show, seats);
        return basePrice * 1.3; // 30% weekend surcharge
    }
}
```

### **Medium Impact (10-15 minutes)**
```java
// Seat Reservation with Timeout
public class Seat {
    private SeatState state; // AVAILABLE, RESERVED, BOOKED
    private LocalDateTime reservationExpiry;
    
    public boolean reserve(int timeoutMinutes) {
        if (state == SeatState.AVAILABLE) {
            state = SeatState.RESERVED;
            reservationExpiry = LocalDateTime.now().plusMinutes(timeoutMinutes);
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

### **High Impact (15-20 minutes)**
```java
// Multi-City Support
public class CityTheaterManager {
    private Map<String, TheaterManager> cityManagers;
    
    public List<Show> findShowsInCity(String city, String movieId) {
        return cityManagers.get(city).findShows(movieId);
    }
}
```

## üé§ Behavioral Questions

### **"Walk me through your design decisions"**
**Answer**: *"I started with domain modeling to understand the core entities. Then I identified the key operations and designed interfaces first. I chose the Strategy pattern for pricing because requirements often change, Factory pattern for consistent object creation, and Observer pattern for loose coupling in notifications."*

### **"How would you handle high concurrency?"**
**Answer**: *"I'd implement optimistic locking for seat booking, use database transactions for consistency, add caching for read-heavy operations like movie listings, and consider event sourcing for audit trails."*

### **"What would you do differently in production?"**
**Answer**: *"I'd add comprehensive logging, implement circuit breakers for external services, add monitoring and metrics, use dependency injection framework, implement proper authentication/authorization, and add comprehensive test coverage."*

### **"How would you scale this to millions of users?"**
**Answer**: *"I'd implement microservices architecture, use event-driven communication, add caching layers (Redis), implement database sharding, use CDN for static content, and add load balancing with auto-scaling."*

## üéØ Key Talking Points

### **Design Patterns**
- *"I'm using Strategy pattern here because pricing rules change frequently"*
- *"Factory pattern ensures consistent booking ID generation"*
- *"Observer pattern allows us to add new notification channels without changing core logic"*

### **SOLID Principles**
- *"Each class has a single responsibility"*
- *"The system is open for extension but closed for modification"*
- *"I'm depending on abstractions, not concrete implementations"*

### **Scalability**
- *"This design supports multiple theaters and cities"*
- *"The service layer can be easily converted to REST APIs"*
- *"Database operations can be optimized with proper indexing"*

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic models, add complexity gradually
2. **Explain as You Code**: Verbalize your thought process
3. **Ask Clarifying Questions**: Show you understand requirements
4. **Test Early**: Run your code frequently to catch issues
5. **Stay Calm**: If stuck, explain your approach and ask for hints
6. **Show Passion**: Demonstrate enthusiasm for clean code and good design

**Remember**: The goal is to show your **problem-solving approach**, **design thinking**, and **coding skills** - not just to finish the implementation!
